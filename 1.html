      title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a>
      is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
      and web applications.</P>
    <p style="margin-top:45px">HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
      It is the fifth and last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
      The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.
      It is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft),
      the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px">HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"
      status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features;
      to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.,
      without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
      HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>
